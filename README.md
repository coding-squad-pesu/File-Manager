# **File Manager**

A **cross-platform, GUI-based file manager written in Python** using **CustomTkinter**.  
The program allows **browsing directories**, **opening files**, **creating and renaming files and folders**, and **navigating drives (Windows only)**.  
It features a **dark theme with blue accents** and a **clean, intuitive interface**.

---

## **Features**

### **File Operations**
- **Open / Enter** – Open files with the system’s default application or enter folders to navigate deeper.  
- **Create Folder** – Create new folders in the current directory.  
- **Create File** – Create new empty files.  
- **Rename** – Rename files or folders.  
- **Delete File** – Delete files only (**folder deletion blocked for safety**).  

### **Navigation**
- **Home** – Return to the user’s home directory.  
- **Back** – Go to the parent folder.  
- **Choose Folder** – Browse and select a folder using a dialog.  
- **Drive Selector (Windows)** – Quickly switch between **C**, **D**, **E**, **F** drives.  
- **Cross-platform** – Works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**. On macOS/Linux, drive selector is replaced with a label.

## **File / Folder Display**

| **Type**   | **Description** |

## **Input Validation / Safety**

- **Implement multi-file selection** and **batch operations**.  
- **Add search functionality** within folders.  
- **Add theme customization** (**light/dark mode toggle**).
